### Import example

Example using terraform import command:

```

Example using the import block (only available in Terraform v1.5.0 and later):

```hcl
resource "incus_storage_bucket" "mybucket" {
  name    = "bucket1"
  pool    = "pool1"
  project = "proj"
}

import {
  to = incus_storage_bucket.mybucket
  id = "proj/pool1/mybucket"
}
```

## Notes

* Incus creates by default for each storage bucket an admin access key
  and a secret key. This key can be imported using the `incus_storage_bucket_key` resource.
